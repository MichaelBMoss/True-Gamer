        MK11 sees the return of Klassic Towers,
        a more straightforward single-player mode
        where you fight a series of opponents before eventually facing big boss Kronika. 
        But the real meat of the single-player offering is the Towers Of Time, 
        MK11's version of the limited-time ladders seen in other NetherRealm games, 
        which feature unique modifiers that can affect the playing field, combatants, and mechanics."
